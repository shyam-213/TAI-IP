                                    <li>Prepare Sugar Syrup: <br>
                                        <p>In a saucepan, add sugar and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat,<br> stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves completely. <br>
                                        Add crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands (if using). <br> Let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes until it slightly thickens. <br>

                                    <li>Prepare Gulab Jamun Dough: <br>

                                            soft dough.Be careful not to over-knead.Cover the dough with <br>a damp cloth and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes.</p></li><br>
                                    <li>Shape and Fry Gulab Jamun:
                                        <p>Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan or kadhai over medium-low heat. <br>
                                            Divide the dough into small portions and roll them into smooth, <br>crack-free balls. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface, as <br>they may break while frying.
                                            Once the oil is hot, carefully slide <br>the gulab jamun balls into the oil, one by one. Do not overcrowd <br> the pan.
                                            Fry the gulab jamuns on low to medium heat, stirring <br> gently and occasionally, until they turn golden brown and <br> 
                                            evenly cooked from all sides. This may take about 8-10 minutes. <br>
                                            Remove the fried gulab jamuns using a slotted spoon brand drain <br> excess oil by placing them on a paper towel.</p>
